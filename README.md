# Java Geofences üó∫Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏è

A geofence system in Java using polygons to define areas on the map. The system is fed with telemetry data to verify positioning and allows the configuration of functionalities for the geofences, such as the detection of entry and exit events from the marked area, in addition to pre-defined infractions, such as speeding within the limits of the fence. When an event or infraction occurs, the system notifies interested parties, ensuring a quick and efficient response.

## Features

- **Geofence Creation**: Define areas on the map using points with latitude and longitude.
- **Telemetry Data**: Feed the system with telemetry data to verify positioning using HTTPS requests or messaging.
- **Event Detection**: Detect entry and exit events from the geofence.
- **Infraction Detection**: Detect infractions, such as speeding within the limits of the fence.
- **Notification System**: Notify interested parties when an event or infraction occurs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker** üê≥ (For containerization)
